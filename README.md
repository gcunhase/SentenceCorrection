# Sentence Correction
The goal of this project is to correct wrong english sentences

NMT: numbers and proper nouns don't need to be considered. If you can translate *John loves Mary*, you can translate *Mary loves John*. If you can translate *Mary is 25 years old*, you can translate *Mary is 35 years old*.
